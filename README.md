## 🚀 About Me
I’m **Mustafa Talha Doğan**, a Computer Engineering graduate from **Konya Technical University (2021–2025)** with a focus on **Web Security & Cybersecurity**. I’ve completed hands-on technical training including the **Türkiye Siber Vatan Program (120+ hours)** and currently practice offensive security techniques, vulnerability analysis and secure development workflows. I combine software development experience (React / Node.js / React Native) with practical pentesting and logging/analysis skills to deliver actionable security reports.

## ✅ How to use this repo (developer / hiring manager friendly)
- `projects/` → finished writeups (PoC + exec summary + remediation).  
- `labs/` → lab notes with screenshots and evidence (PDF).  
- `tools/` → scripts (Python/Bash) with usage examples and sample outputs.  
- **Goal:** every technical note should include a testable PoC or runnable script so reviewers can reproduce results.

### If you want: next step checklist I can auto-generate for you
- Convert `Web-Pentest-notlari/` into `projects/`, `labs/`, `tools/` subfolders and add `README.md` to each.  
- Prepare 3 project writeups (SQLi PoC, XSS PoC, netscan tool) and I’ll review their READMEs and exec summaries.  
- Hook TryHackMe badges and Splunk/other cert images into this README.
